# StInLaSimFoam
Hybrid solver between icoFoam and simpleFoam. StInLaSim stands for Steady Incompressible Laminar Simple. 

No need to specify separate turbulence properties file in the constant folder as we specify in SimpleFOAM. 

It employs steady state SIMPLE algorithm. 

fvOptions has been enabled which was not present in icoFoam.
